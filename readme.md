# Set Day & Night Cycle

A Transport Fever 2 mod that adds an option to change the time of day from Morning to Noon to Dusk to Night.
The option is found in the mod-settings (before starting/loading a game).

# Archived Project

This mod was a compromise as I wanted the day-night cycle to be dynamic, but this was not possible in the current game engine. In anticipation of Transport Fever 3 I have archived all my mods for TF2.
